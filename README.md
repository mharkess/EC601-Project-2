# EC601-Project-2

This project is about doing sentiment analysis on the people that are retweeting at a particular twitter account. The reason that I decided to do this type of project is that
I thought for people who are 'popular' it would be important for them to have an idea about what the public thinks about them. So, this program takes the average sentiment of the last 20 tweets with the user being tagged and shows it to the requester. In addition, the user can also view those last 20 tweets to get an idea of what the contents of the tweets that were analyzed were.

This project was mainly developed using Flask.
